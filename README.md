# Render Selected Strips
Blender add-on for quickly rendering selected sequencer strips.

# Usage
- Set up your render settings (file format, encoding, etc.)
- Select your strips in the video sequence editor

> Make sure to only select one strip per range!
> This operator renders a video for *every* selected strip.
> E.g. select **only** video strips for any given section, **not** their audio strips.

- Open the *Strip* menu and select the *Render Selected Strips* operator at the bottom
- Navigate to your destination folder
- Confirm

## Additional Tools
The sequencer's *Add* menu is extended with two addtional operators to import multiple files at once:
- Stills
- Movies

Newly added strips will be placed at the current frame, one after another in alphabetical order.
